# About the lab

We are a dry lab focused on computational evolutionary genetics. We develop methods and software to understand evolutionary history, with a particular focus on large genomics datasets. Researchers in the lab come from the fields of computer science, math, and evolutionary biology.

We also work to make our research reproducible and teach research skills to students and other researchers.

Interested in joining the lab as a postdoc, grad student, or undergraduate? See [available positions]({{< ref "positions.md" >}}).
